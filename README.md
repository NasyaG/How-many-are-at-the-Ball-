# How-many-are-at-the-Ball-
A people counter created used vanilla Js.
## The Why
Balls are a way for black and brown LGBT+ folks to commune with one another. It is a force, a vibe, an experience that if you are so lucky to witness or partake in will change you forever :sparkle:

Balls can and do get crowded however and it is impoortant to keep track of how many people who are in attendance.

## The How
This counter was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as an assignment from Scrimba's free JavaScript course.
